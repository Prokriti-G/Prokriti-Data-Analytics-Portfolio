# Café Menu Analysis (SQL Project)

## Objective
Analyze the café’s new menu to identify which items are performing well, which are underperforming, and what the top customers prefer. The goal is to provide actionable insights for menu planning and customer engagement.

## Dataset
- Source: [Maven Analytics](https://app.mavenanalytics.io/guided-projects/d7167b45-6317-49c9-b2bb-42e2a9e9c0bc#dataset)

## Process
1. Explored `menu_table` to understand the new menu items and categories.  
2. Explored `order_details` to see which items were ordered most frequently.  
3. Used JOINs to combine the tables for a complete view of customer purchases.  
4. Applied aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`) and `GROUP BY` to summarize orders and revenue.  
5. Identified top customers by frequency and spending.

## Key Insights
- The most ordered item is a Hamburger and least ordered item is Chicken Tacos.  
- 
- The analysis demonstrates how top customers differ in ordering behavior compared to average customers.  
- The dashboard enables management to explore trends dynamically and make informed menu decisions.  

 ## Next steps: 
 With more detailed or larger datasets, further insights could include seasonal trends or item combinations that drive sales.
