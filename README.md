# Prokriti-Data-Analytics-Portfolio
Data analytics projects demonstrating my growing skills in Excel, SQL, and data storytelling through real-world datasets.
## Objective
Analyze customer demographic and lifestyle data to uncover trends influencing bike purchases. The goal is to identify which factors, such as income, gender, marital status, age, and commute distance — have the greatest impact on a customer’s likelihood to purchase a bike.
## Dataset
[Github Dataset](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx)
## Process
- Cleaned and formatted the raw dataset using Excel tables.
- Created pivot tables to summarize relationships between demographics and bike purchases.  
- Designed an interactive dashboard using pivot charts and slicers for dynamic filtering by region, gender, and occupation.  
- Visualized insights with bar charts and line graphs to make patterns easy to interpret.
## Key Insights
- The interactive dashboard allows users to explore data dynamically, filtering by multiple variables (e.g., occupation, home ownership, number of cars) to look for potential correlations.
- No single demographic factor (age, gender, marital status, income) strongly predicts bike purchases — customers are fairly evenly distributed across these groups.
- Slight patterns can be observed when filtering by region or commute distance, but overall trends are subtle.
