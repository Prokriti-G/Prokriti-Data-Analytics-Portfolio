# Tableau Airline Analysis

## Project overview

This project analyzes customer satisfaction with **British Airways** across different countries and time periods. Using Tableau, I explored key service metrics such as overall rating, food and beverages, cabin crew service, ground service, and seat comfort. The interactive dashboard allows users to filter by service category and observe how customer experiences vary geographically and seasonally. This visualization highlights performance trends across regions, helping identify which aspects of service are consistently rated highly and which areas may need improvement.
